## Fact Tables

### `f_book_inventory`
Snapshot fact table capturing the daily state of book inventory, including current unit price and stock levels per day.

### `f_order_item_transactions`
Event-based fact table detailing individual order item transactions. It aligns with SCD dimensions to reflect customer, order, and book attributes at the time of the event.

### `f_shipment_events`
Transactional fact table logging shipment events, including status updates, costs, and delivery timelines. Integrates with SCD2 dimensions for order and carrier context.

## Dimension Tables

### `d_books`
Book dimension (SCD Type 0) storing static book and author data as recorded at the time of book ingestion.

### `d_carriers_services`
Hybrid SCD dimension combining carrier and service data. Uses SCD0 for identifiers, SCD1 for contact details, and SCD2 for price and service validity.

### `d_customers`
Customer dimension with a hybrid SCD approach: Type 0 for IDs, Type 1 for names, and Type 2 for contact/address changes over time.

### `d_orders`
SCD Type 2 dimension capturing historical versions of customer orders, tracking status, shipping methods, and order dates.

### `d_shipments`
Type 1 dimension for shipments, maintaining only the latest state of each shipment record.
